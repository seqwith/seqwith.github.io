        <h2>What is this site for???</h2>
        <p>Welcome, this site is a place for me to begin showing the world my work.  I have been working on some side projects, and plan to load them onto my website for all to see.  
        </p>  
        <p>This site will be in a constant state of work, and will probably never be done.  As I learn new things I will be working them into the project.  I hope to also create a blog on here to talk about my experience with learning new things, as i progress.
